# afnetworking-wrapper
A simple convenience wrapper over the AFNetworking library for iOS. You will need to have the AFNetworking library installed to use this.

Simply add the .h and .m files to your project and import in any view controller to start using. The library contains convenience methods to return an array, dictionary or image depending on the API response. It also has a built in reachability method for checking the inthernet connection.
